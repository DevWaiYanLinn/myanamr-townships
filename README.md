# Myanmar City Map Project Documentation

## Introduction

The Myanmar City Map project offers an interactive webpage displaying a map of Myanmar. When a user hovers over different regions on the map, a list of cities within that region is dynamically displayed. This enhances user experience by providing quick access to city information based on the region of interest.

**Webpage Link**: [Myanmar City Map Webpage](https://devwaiyanlinn.github.io/myanamr-townships)

## Usage

1. Open the [Myanmar City Map webpage](https://devwaiyanlinn.github.io/myanamr-townships).
2. Hover your cursor over a specific region on the map.
3. A tooltip will appear, showing the region's name and a list of cities within that region.

## Project Details

The project primarily consists of the following components:

- **HTML Page**: Contains the structure of the webpage and the SVG map visualization.
- **JavaScript**: Manages the interactivity of the map and tooltips.
- **City Data**: JSON files storing city information for different regions.

## How It Works

1. The HTML page integrates the SVG map visualization and provides the canvas for interactivity.
2. JavaScript is utilized to detect hover events on different regions.
3. When a user hovers over a region, the script fetches the corresponding city data from the JSON files.
4. A tooltip is dynamically generated and displayed, showing the region's name and the list of cities.

## Customization

To customize the project:

- **Map Styling**: Modify the CSS to change the appearance of the SVG map and tooltips.
- **City Data**: Update the JSON files in the project to add or edit city information.
