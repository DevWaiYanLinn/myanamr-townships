## Introduction

The Myanmar City Map project offers an interactive webpage displaying a map of Myanmar. When a user hovers over different regions on the map, a list of cities within that region is dynamically displayed. This enhances user experience by providing quick access to city information based on the region of interest.

## Usage

1. Open the [Myanmar City Map webpage](https://devwaiyanlinn.github.io/myanamr-townships).
2. Hover your cursor over a specific region on the map.
3. A tooltip will appear, showing the region's name and a list of cities within that region.

## Project Details

The project primarily consists of the following components:

- **HTML Page**: Contains the structure of the webpage and the SVG map visualization.
- **JavaScript**: Manages the interactivity of the map and tooltips.
- **City Data**: JSON files storing city information for different regions.

## Customization

To customize the project:

- **Map Styling**: Modify the CSS to change the appearance of the SVG map and tooltips.
- **City Data**: Update the JSON files in the project to add or edit city information.
